When I select an option from the van dropdown corresponding to a ride,
I want that ride to be assigned a van id from the selected option. I
then want navigator "pages" (entries?) whose ids (not null or 0) are equal
to van_ids to display rides with said van_ids.


#the assign_van method within ride class should either assign an
#entry from the ride table a new attribute called van, or push the
#entry to a new table.

#the first option is preferable, because it will be simpler and will
#reduce redundancy.

#auto assign w/ drop down?


name
student id
phone number
number of passengers
origin (postal)
destination (postal)
